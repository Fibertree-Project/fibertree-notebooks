    "# Explanation of the \"<<\" operation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the more complex operators in the fiber tree execution model is the \"<<\" operator, which is used when performing a computation in which values are being inserted into (or used to update values in) a fiber. \n",
    "\n",
    "TLDR; For the operation ```z_i << a_i``` on fibers ```z_i``` and ```a_i```, the ```<<``` operator indicates that for every coordinate of an element in ```a_i``` one wants to update the payload of an element in ```z_i``` with that same coordinate. The expression does its work in two steps: First, it takes every coordinate in ```a_i``` and if that coordinate does not exist in ```z_i``` it inserts an element at that coordinate in the ```z_i``` fiber with a \"default\" payload. Second, it applies the intersection operator (```&```) on the **new** ```z_i``` and **original** ```a_i``` and returns the resulting fiber (Note that newly inserted elements in ```z_i``` always survive the intersection).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are set of invariants maintained when the expression ```f_i = z_i << a_i``` is executed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- coords(f_i) == coords(a_i)\n",
    "- coords(z_i') == coords(a_i) + coords(z_i), where ```z_i'``` is the value of ```z_i``` after the expression is executed\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If that was too terse, the following cells will illustrate the use of the operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "But first, we include some libraries and provide some dropdown lists to select the display style and type of animation."

    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to create an output in a rank-1 tensor ```z``` for every non-empty coordinate in a rank-1 input tensor ```a```. To do this, we would like to populate an initially empty tensor ```z``` with the \"default\" value (in this case zero) for each non-empty element of ```a```. To accomplish this, we can use the fiber tree ```<<``` operator. However, since the ```<<``` operator works on **fibers** we first get the root fibers (which are both of rank \"I\") out of the ```a``` and ```z``` tensors, and then apply the ```<<``` operator.\n",

Those elements are unpacked as a tuple of the form ```(i, (z_ref, a_val))```, where ```i``` is a coordinate and ```(z_ref, a_val)``` is a payload tuple containing a reference to a payload in ```z``` and a payload value from ```a```. \n",

This is handled cleanly by operator overloading in Python.  (Foreshadow: Using a plain ```=``` to overwrite a payload in ```z``` will not work. To address this we add an ```<<=``` operator to overwrite a payload)\n",
